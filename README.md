**#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering**

**1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It applies engineering principles to software development to ensure efficiency, reliability, and scalability. It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of complex software systems that drive businesses, innovation, and everyday applications.

**2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**  
A. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) - The term "software engineering" was first used at a NATO conference to address the growing software crisis and the need for structured development practices.
B. Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s) - Languages like C++ and Java revolutionized software development by enabling modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
C. Agile Manifesto (2001) - The Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development, shifting focus from rigid methodologies to adaptive, customer-centric development.

**3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
    Requirement Analysis - Gathering and analyzing user needs.
    Planning - Defining scope, timeline, and resources.
    Design - Creating software architecture and UI/UX design.
    Implementation (Coding) - Writing the actual code.
    Testing - Ensuring functionality and fixing defects.
    Deployment - Releasing the software to users.
    Maintenance - Updating and fixing issues post-deployment.
**4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
    A. Waterfall Methodology:
        a. Sequential and structured.
        b. Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements (e.g., construction or banking software).
    B. Agile Methodology:
        a. Iterative and flexible.
        b. Best for projects requiring continuous updates (e.g., mobile apps, web services).
**5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
    a. Software Developer - Writes and maintains code.
    b. Quality Assurance Engineer - Tests software to identify and resolve defects.
    c.Project Manager - Oversees project scope, timeline, and coordination among team members.
**6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
    a. IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA) provide tools for efficient coding, debugging, and testing.
    b. VCS (e.g., Git, SVN) enables version tracking, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.
**7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
    a. Managing Complexity - Use modular design and documentation.
    b. Meeting Deadlines - Employ Agile methodologies and task prioritization.
    c. Debugging Issues - Implement thorough testing and logging mechanisms.
**8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
    a. Unit Testing - Tests individual components.
    b. Integration Testing - Ensures modules work together.
    c. System Testing - Validates the entire application.
    d. Acceptance Testing - Confirms software meets business needs.
**#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering**

**1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
    Prompt engineering involves designing effective inputs for AI models to achieve desired responses. It enhances interaction with AI, improving accuracy and relevance.

**2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
    a. Vague Prompt: "Tell me about programming."
    b. Improved Prompt: "Explain the key programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural) with examples."
    c. Why Itâ€™s Better: The improved prompt is specific, detailed, and guides the AI towards a precise response.
